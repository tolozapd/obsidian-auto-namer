# obsidian-auto-namer
A plugin for Obsidian that automatically names your files based on predefined patterns.

Every time you create a new file, the plugin opens a window like this:

By default, the naming pattern follows this format:
`customName-YYYYMMDDHHmmss-typeFile`

- `customName`: A name set by the user
- `YYYYMMDDHHmmss`: Timestamp (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second)
- `typeFile`: The type of file being created

**Upcoming Features:**

In future updates, the naming pattern will be fully customizable, allowing users to define their own structure to better fit their workflow.
